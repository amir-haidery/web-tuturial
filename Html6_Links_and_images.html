<!-- 
In the body tag, if you type “a", anchor tag will appear. 
Just hit the enter key or if you want you can manually write the whole tag. Refer to the declaration below:

<a href=""> </a>

Here href is the attribute of anchor tag where you have to write the URL of the website or Link that you want to open. 
Next, you have to write the Keyword on which you want the user to click so that he will be redirected to the linked website. 
Refer to the example below:

<a href="https://google.com">Go to Google</a>

Now, the problem arises here is that as soon as we click on the keyword, 
the website will open on the same webpage but if in case you want to open the website in a new tab then you have to add
 a new attribute in the anchor tag I.e. “target"
To open a website in a new tab, you have to write something like this:

<a href="https://google.com" target = "_blank">Go to Google</a>

-->
<!-- 
    Tag is like a container that allows you to handle an element 
    whereas attribute is the property that enhances that container makes it more convenient to use.
-->
<!-- In order to insert an image in a webpage, you have to use the img tag. 

An img tag generally have two basic attributes “src" and “alt".

<img src="" alt="">

Here “src" is the field where you have to insert the URL or address of the image and the “alt" attribute is a field 
that will display to users if their browser fails to load the image. 
In the “alt" tag, we generally input a keyword of the image that can define the image in case the user can’t see the image. 
For instance:
<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/random" alt= "Error loading image">

Here a random image will be loaded because this URL stores multiple images and any one of them gets reloaded every time we refresh the 
webpage. -->
