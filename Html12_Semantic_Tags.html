<!-- In very simple language, Semantic means to provide meaning to any word. If we talk in about a web page, then earlier most of the websites are made only using divs including different classes and IDs in them. But that was not the correct way of telling the search engines that if the elements are header, footer, or any other body.

There are many examples of Semantics. You can take the reference of the internet to view all. Here are some of the important semantic elements- -->
<!-- 
<header>
<nav>
<section>
<article>
<footer> -->


     <!-- every thing about sematric -->
