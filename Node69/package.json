/* 
NPM helps us to manage the packages in NodeJs.To understand this,
 we will make a new directory as tut69.Till now, we have only one file inside this directory i.e.,
Node69.js.But as soon as we write npm init on the terminal, it asks several questions like the package name, version, description, entry point, keyword, author, etc.When we execute this, 
there is a new file called package.json inside the Node69 directory.
