<!-- The object class represents one of JavaScriptâ€™s data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor. we have two types of values used in JavaScript- primitive and reference. To be more simple, either we create objects or primitive data types.  -->


<!-- There is a special kind of object known as Arrays. The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high level, list-like objects. An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.  -->
