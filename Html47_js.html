<!-- In this tutorial, we will see How to write JavaScript and what are the methods to write it. We will make a new file as
tut47.html and add an instant boilerplate to get the basic HTML code to get started. Then give the title as JavaScript
Tutorial under the <title> tag.

    The next step is to add the HTML code in the body. We will add the container and a simple paragraph as shown below,
    just to understand the concept of JavaScript. -->


<!-- Console is the only place, where you will find all the errors made in the code. If you have locked any request or have
applied AJAX in the code, the errors regarding all these things will be shown in the console tab itself. Also, we can
see the values of different variables if written in the code. Although there may be a chance that if you are using any
other browser apart from Chrome like Firefox or Safari, you may find a different console tab, the high-level ideas of
all the browsers will be the same. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Chrome browser due to its high developer
tools.

So I believe you must have got some basic ideas about JavaScript and the developer console provided by the browser.
Furthermore, in the tutorials, we will see some advanced features of JavaScripts and how to make a professional website
with a hamburger icon on it. To learn more about JavaScript stay with the tutorials. -->
