<!-- An entity is a piece of text (“string”) that begins with an ‘&’ and ends with a ‘;’. These are frequently used to display reserved characters, and invisible characters. As usual, let us begin the tutorial by making a new HTML file as tut11.html and add an instant boilerplate to get the basic template of HTML. Give the title as HTML Entities in the <title> tag.

    Try to understand with the below example. If we write the code as
    
    <div class= “container”>
                <p>This is a Paragraph</p>
    </div>
    <div class= “container”>
              <p>This is another Paragraph</p>
    </div> -->

    <div class="container">
        <p>This is another     paragraph with two spaces</p>
        <p>Paragraph is written like this <p> </p>
        <p>Pound is written like this £ </p>
        <p>Copyright is written like this © </p>
        <p>Another character is  ⇛ </p>
        <p>Another character is  ¼ </p>
        <p>Empty character is written like this &#8203​ </p>
    </div>
