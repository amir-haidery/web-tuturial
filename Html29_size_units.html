<!-- What Is Responsive Design?
Have you ever noticed that websites nowadays adjust themselves according to the resolution of your device(Smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer)? Isn't it amazing that a website is automatically changing its height and width according to the size of the user's screen? This is possible because of the responsive design. Let's dive deep into responsive design.

Responsive design is a way for a web developer to make a website adapt to all the devices and resolutions.

Endless new resolutions and devices are challenging to support separately for a web developer; therefore, responsive design is the best approach to develop a website that can adjust itself according to the screen size.

Responsive design is a necessity and not a luxury anymore!
Various Ways To Achieve Responsive Design :
By using em/rem/vh/vw/ units over pixels.

By using max-width/max-height.

Using CSS Media Queries.

Setting up the viewport. -->

<!-- 1- em 
Font-sizes are inherited relative to the parent element.

10em means ten times of the parent element.
you can see that the font-size of the first heading is changed. Earlier the font-size was 10px because <h1> inherited this size from its parent element, i.e., container. Now, the font-size of <h1> has changed to 100px because 10 em means ten times of the parent element so 10*10=100px. -->

    <!-- 2- rem
Font-size gets set according to the font-size of the root element.

In general, <html> is the root element.

In rem, "r" stands for "root."

ou can see that the font size of the second heading has changed from 7px to 70px because 10rem is equal to 10 times the root element. You can verify the font-size with the help inspect element functionality of the chrome browser.-->

<!-- 3-vw
It stands for viewport width.

Similar to vh, vw is equal to the 1/100 times of the viewport width.

Example: Suppose width of the browser is 1000px, so 1vw is equaled to (1/100)*1000= 10px.

ou can see that the border's width is changed to 100% of the viewport. This tutorial ends here, and I believe that all the concepts discussed in this tutorial are crystal clear to you. -->
