<!-- 1- The JavaScript variables are the containers for storing data values.  -->


<!-- 2- As discussed earlier, variables are the data that stores value. Therefore, in the below example a and b are the
variables that store integer and String values respectively. -->

<!--3- The result of both the variables will be displayed in the console tab of the browser. These types of variables are known as dynamic typing as you do not require to identify the data type -->
<!-- 
Let us now understand the operators in JavaScript. There are two types of operators present in JavaScript- Binary Operators and Unary Operators. Unary Operators work only on 1 operand. For example, 3+4. On the other hand, Binary operators work only on 2 operands. For example, x= x+6. Here ‘=’ and ‘+’ are two operands. -->

        // In 3 + 4 '+' is the operator and 3,4 are operands
        // 1. unary operator - It has single operand (x = -x)
